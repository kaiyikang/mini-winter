### Load Classes and Files

We need to load all the classes first before we can go into the container.

In unit tests, compiled test classes end up under the test classpath (e.g., Maven: target/test-classes/com/kaiyikang/scan/\*), and resources are copied to the same classpath root with the same package layout (e.g., target/test-classes/com/kaiyikang/scan/sub1.txt).

### Property Resolver

To parse queries of the type `${app.title:default}`, a recursive approach can be adopted to handle highly complex situations, such as `${app.path:${app.home:${ENV_NOT_EXIST:/not-exist}}}`.

First, the core `public String getProperty(String key)` method is called. If the `key` can be continuously parsed by `PropertyExpr parsePropertyExpr(String key)` to yield a default value, it means the recursion has not ended. Once the recursion is complete, a similar logic is used to resolve the resulting value, as the value itself could also be a string like `${app.title:default}`, until a final value is reached. If the final value is null, an error is thrown; otherwise, the value is returned.

The specific design is quite ingenious. For details, please refer to `PropertyResolver.getProperty()`.

## Thinking

1. Read the class or method before writing it, thinking about its functionalities and how it is written.
