## IOC

### Load Classes and Files

We need to load all the classes first before we can go into the container.

In unit tests, compiled test classes end up under the test classpath (e.g., Maven: target/test-classes/com/kaiyikang/scan/\*), and resources are copied to the same classpath root with the same package layout (e.g., target/test-classes/com/kaiyikang/scan/sub1.txt).

### Property Resolver

## Thinking

1. Read the class or method before writing it, thinking about its functionalities and how it is written.
